Documentation is just any sequence of lines that do not begin with a `>`.
This will not generate empty documentation, but it does preserve empty lines.

> Doc = (doc.line Nl? | Nl)+
> doc.line =
>   / [^ >'\n' ]   # one character on the line that is not `>`
>     [^ '\n'  ]*  # any other characters on the line
>   /

> Nl = "\n"
